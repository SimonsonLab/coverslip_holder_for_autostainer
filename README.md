# coverslip_holder_for_autostainer
This repository contains CAD/design files for a coverslip holder that we use to stain coverslips using a Leica BOND RX instrument.  The files were created using FreeCAD software.


Version 1 works pretty well and is the recommended version to use.  Specifically, the "2020-11-16 Simonson coverslip holder.iges" file in the version 1 folder can be used for making the actual part by a machine shop or prototyping service.

If you find this helpful for your own work, we would appreciate you citing this paper (which also contains the details of how we had the coverslip holders manufactured using the pertinent IGS/IGES file):
